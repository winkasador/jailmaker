Hi,

Please do not modify the contents of this folder.

This folder provides JAILMAKER with important content in case of problems with loading.
If the program crashes at startup, can't find any mods, or finds multiple mods and needs to ask you which to load, it
will need to use content provided in this folder.

Modifying or removing things from this folder might cause it to break in those instances.

Sincerely,
Winkassador!
