## Data Collected
| Data | Reason |
| - | - |
| Exception, Error Message, and Stack Trace | So we know what the error was and why it happened.
| OS Name and Version | Different OS versions can present different errors, knowing which OS [software name] was running on can help highlight why a specific issue may have occurred.
| Software Version | So we know which versions the error is present on, and so it can be ignored if the issue is already fixed on a newer version.
| Software Signature | This indicates whether the application has been modified. A modified application may present errors not present in the official build.
| Resource Usage | This means CPU, RAM, and GPU use. Provides information about what the program was doing and if it was behaving unusually when the crash occurred.
| Device Information | Information about the device the software is running on. This includes how much RAM, type of CPU, type of GPU and GPU version. This can be used to work out if an issue was triggered by obsolete drivers, old technology, etc.
